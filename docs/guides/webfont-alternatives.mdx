This guide will outline some alternatives of the Webfont and why other solutions might be more ideal.

## What is the webfont?

The webfont is several font files that your browser can pick from. All modern browsers will pick the `woff2` font file to download. This font as of `v7.1.96` is **392 KB** and the CSS is **53.1 KB** compressed and growing with each release.

- Large Size (larger than any modern web framework)
- Use only 10 Icons and it includes all.

<Note>
  In a scenerio where the frontend does not know all required icons, it may be ideal to use the webfont.

## Other Solutions

### Iconify

Instead of using the webfont, you can use the Iconify SVG framework. It is as easy to use as the webfont, but it only loads icons that are used on page and renders them as pixel perfect SVG rather than text. Read [Iconify Guide](/docs/guides/iconify) guide on how to use MDI and MDI Light with Iconify.

### React

For those using the React framework, there is a first party provided component `@mdi/react`.

<Button href='/docs/library/mdi/getting-started/react' startIcon='si:react'>View the React Guide</Button>

### Angular

<Button href='/docs/library/mdi/getting-started/angular' startIcon='si:angular'>View the Angular Guide</Button>

### VueJS

<Button href='/docs/library/mdi/getting-started/vuejs' startIcon='si:vuedotjs'>View the VueJS Guide</Button>

### Other

The `@mdi/js` library contains all the icon path data. Due to tree-shaking, you ensure you're only including the icons that are needed.

```javascript
import { mdiAccount } from '@mdi/js';

// mdiAccount = 'M12,4A4,4 0 0,1 16,8A4,4 0 0,1 12,12A4,4 0 0,1 8,8A4,4 0 0,1 12,4M12,14C16.42,14 20,15.79 20,18V20H4V18C4,15.79 7.58,14 12,14Z'

document.querySelector('svg path').setAttribute('d', mdiAccount);
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path d="" />
</svg>
```
