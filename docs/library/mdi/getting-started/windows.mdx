The Universal Windows Platform and WPF both use a vector format similar to SVG.

## Inline XAML

If you wanted to display the icon at `48x48` place the SVG path data in place of `M...Z`.

```xml
<Viewbox Width="48" Height="48">
    <Canvas Width="24" Height="24">
        <Path Data="M...Z" Fill="Black" />
    </Canvas>
</Viewbox>
```
## Windows SDK with Win UI 3

To add it to your project add the webfont file and set it's build action to `Content`.
In your `App.xaml` file add like this, modify according to your path, in the example it's placed inside the Assets folder.

```xml
<FontFamily x:Key="IconFont">ms-appx:///Assets/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf#Material Design Icons</FontFamily>
